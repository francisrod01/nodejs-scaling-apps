# Advanced Node.js: Scaling Applications

While Node.js is great for creating small apps with minimal surface areas, it was designed to scale.

Learn here sophisticated programming techniques that can help you scale your Node.js applications.

Repo author: [Francis Rodrigues][1]

## Learning objectives

This repo is based on [Alex Banks][2] course, that goes over the scale cube, discussing the different directions in which an app can be scaled:

- Cloning
- The scale cube
- Scaling the x-axis, z-axis, and y-axis
- Forking Node.js processes *(and work with clusters with PM2)*
- Implementing a database instance
- Database scaling
- Setting up horizontal partitioning *(to split data between databases)*
- Decomposing your app into microservices
